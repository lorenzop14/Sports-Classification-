Train of a deep learning model (ResNet-like architecture) to classify images into 12 sports-related categories.
After preprocessing the data I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to learn discriminative features
from images of various sports. To improve the modelâ€™s performance, I applied data augmentation techniques. I then
trained and evaluated the model, using accuracy as the primary metric for evaluation. Finally, I generated a confusion
matrix and classification reports to present the results.
